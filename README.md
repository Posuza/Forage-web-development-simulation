-Analyze Site Map:  Think of the sitemap as your website's blueprint.  Find it (footer, /sitemap.xml, or use a crawler).  Look for how pages are organized (hierarchy), how easy it is to navigate, what content exists, and what's missing. This helps you spot structural problems, content gaps, and navigation issues.

-Draw User Flow:  Imagine how a user achieves a goal (e.g., donating).  Map out the steps they take, page by page. This reveals confusing steps or roadblocks in their journey, highlighting areas for improvement. Use a simple tool (even pen and paper) to visualize this.

-Start Adding: Based on your analysis, prioritize improvements.  Add missing content, update old stuff, and make content clearer.  Consider new features (search, contact forms) and improve existing ones.  Update the design for a better look and usability, especially on mobile.  Always keep the NGO's mission and who they're trying to reach in mind.
